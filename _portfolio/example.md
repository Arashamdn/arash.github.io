SARV administrative building (programmed to serve the administration of employee’s retirement funds for Ayandeh Bank) located at Tehran’s Saadatabad district is the result of the juxtaposition of a number of conceptual layers, each relating to the extraordinary legacy of architecture in Iran. The deep-rooted concepts that have nourished the development of the design form, can be considered from two main viewpoints:



1. Interpreting the concept of the vault:
Historically, a vault – in Persian, Sandoq- is a large container, originally large earthen vessels, and later made of wood and iron for the safe-keeping of precious and valuable items such as gems and gold. Today, the physical vault has been largely replaced by other means and mechanisms for safe-keeping, such as banks, governments, and retirement institutions working through pensions, IRA’s, workers’ welfare policies, employee retirement policies, and other similar provisions. While the vault was maintained in the trust of the home, the sustainability and reputation of a safe-keeping mechanism outside the house is directly proportional to the public confidence that it can maintain. Therefore, today, the equivalent of the vault should resemble a transparent jewel, a sparkling diamond in which the public’s interests can be ensured through transparency, and the citizens’ assets can be safe-guarded with transparent practices.
2. The Persian Garden (Chahar-Baq: four gardens, garden of four,) as the image of earthly paradise, is rooted in the fertile imagination of the Persian architect in response to the intense connection with the garden in the Persian psyche, and dramatic diversity of Iran’s terrain and landscape. In recent history, unruly urbanization has severed the vital connection between the Persian people and the garden. This has contributed to the deterioration of millennia-old high quality of life in Iran, both in practical and spiritual terms. The critical role of architecture in “Chahar-Baq” is to provide light, ventilation, water, and greenery.

The building is organized with a point-grid steel structural system, and operates with a single vertical core connecting all floors from parking through the commercial ground floor and mezzanine, and the administrative offices on floors 1-6. At each administrative floor, the core “reaches out” into the floors with free-form “arms” that contain all services (bathrooms, kitchens, wet-rooms…,) the secure areas (meeting and conference rooms, archives and storage rooms,) the horizontal circulation routes, and above all the private administrative and managerial rooms.
