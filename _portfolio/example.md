SARV administrative building (programmed to serve the administration of employee’s retirement funds for … Bank,) located at Tehran’s Sa’adatabad district is the result of the juxtaposition of a number of conceptual layers, each relating to the extraordinary legacy of architecture in Iran. The deep-rooted concepts that have nourished the development of the design form, can be considered from two main viewpoints:

1. Interpreting the concept of the vault:
Historically, a vault – in Persian, Sandoq- is a large container, originally large earthen vessels, and later made of wood and iron for the safe-keeping of precious and valuable items such as gems and gold. Today, the physical vault has been largely replaced by other means and mechanisms for safe-keeping, such as banks, governments, and retirement institutions working through pensions, IRA’s, workers’ welfare policies, employee retirement policies, and other similar provisions. While the vault was maintained in the trust of the home, the sustainability and reputation of a safe-keeping mechanism outside the house is directly proportional to the public confidence that it can maintain. Therefore, today, the equivalent of the vault should resemble a transparent jewel, a sparkling diamond in which the public’s interests can be ensured through transparency, and the citizens’ assets can be safe-guarded with transparent practices.
