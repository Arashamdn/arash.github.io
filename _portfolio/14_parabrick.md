This project involves the use of parametric design techniques to create a brick wall that optimizes the amount of light and vision required in a given space. The process begins by modeling a simple wall in Rhino, which is then divided into smaller segments. Each segment is then assigned an optimized value, depending on the desired amount of light and vision required. This is achieved by using parametric bricks that can be manipulated to control the amount of openings in the wall, based on the tilt factor of each brick.

By using this approach, the final design is able to achieve an optimal balance between light, vision and privacy. The parametric bricks allow for a high degree of flexibility and customization, making it possible to fine-tune the design based on the specific needs of the space. This approach also enables the designer to explore a wide range of design options, and to quickly iterate and refine the design until the desired balance is achieved. Overall, this project demonstrates the power of parametric design techniques in creating customized and optimized solutions for architectural design challenges.

After the design phase, the project moves to the fabrication stage, where a parametric mold for building bricks is created. The mold is designed with two moving sides that rotate on an axis, allowing for the production of bricks with two different angles on each side. This approach makes it possible to create highly customized bricks that can be used to construct walls with a high degree of flexibility and control over the amount of light and vision required. The team is able to successfully build the mold and produce a series of prototype bricks for the final presentation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the parametric design approach in creating a highly functional and adaptable architectural solution. This project highlights the importance of integrating design and fabrication processes, and demonstrates the potential for parametric design techniques to revolutionize the way we approach architectural design and construction.

Here is a demonstration of the mold:
