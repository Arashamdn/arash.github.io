- **Location:** Lavasan, Tehran, Iran
- **Date:** 2020
- **Area:** 750 sq.m
- **Category:** Architectural Concept Design
- **Program:** Villa

The concept for this villa was primarily based on both the context and the specific location of the site. The final design was the result of the decision to retain all the existing trees on the site, and to provide the best views possible to the features of the natural surroundings, such as the mountains, a river, and a nearby dam.
As the requirement was to provide four private living quarters within the villa, each unit was oriented in order to achieve a unique view. The floors are to be supported by cylindrical structures that would also contain the vertical access routes. Moreover, the rotations of the units provide for separate green terraces at each floor, as well as a shared swimming pool and gym at the uppermost level. The exterior would consist of openable louvres to allow extended views and the control of sunlight.
