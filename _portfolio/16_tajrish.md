A proposed urban architecture intervention for Tehran’s dynamic TAJRISH bus terminal and bazaar area. By placing a slab over the existing bus terminal to the West of Tajrish Bazaar, level with Tajrish Roundabout and taking advantage of a 4.5 level difference,

1- The terminal becomes roofed, protected, and visually separated from the immediate environment. 

2- A square/plaza is formed level with the existing roundabout. 

3- local pedestrian, in particular, and also vehicular circulation is reorganized. 

4- Treating the expansive slab as a newly invented site, small/medium sized structures can be carefully tucked in on the edges, thus augmenting the project’s budgetary feasibility.
