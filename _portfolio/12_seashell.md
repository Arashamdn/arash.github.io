The Seashell is a 150 room five-star hotel in Kish Island. After visiting the project site and carefully considering the original finished architectural design for the seashell hotel project, we concluded that it had several flaws. After discussions with the clients, it was decided to create a new architectural design for the project. Our inspiration for the new design came from the simple shape of a seashell.

We wanted the building to mimic the natural curves and lines of a seashell, creating a sense of harmony between the architecture and the surrounding environment. To achieve this, we utilized a combination of modern building materials and traditional construction techniques. We opted for a curved and asymmetrical shape for the building, with large windows and open spaces to take advantage of the beautiful ocean views.

Sustainable design elements were also incorporated into the project, such as solar panels and rainwater harvesting systems. These features not only reduce the building's environmental impact but also provide cost savings to the owners over the long term.

Overall, we are proud of the new design for the seashell hotel project. It not only addresses the flaws of the original design but also enhances the overall aesthetic and functionality of the building. We believe that our design will create a unique and memorable experience for guests while also respecting and protecting the surrounding environment.
