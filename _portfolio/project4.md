This project is a crucial part of the Ferdowsi University campus master plan, representing the first of eight tramway stations that are aligned through the Tramway axis. The primary focus of the project is the design and layout of station #1, with an aim to meet the following criteria:

Sustainability is the fundamental consideration of most architectural discussions today. Therefore, the project has been created to serve as a lively, active, and dynamic place for students, prioritizing sustainability in the design.

Legibility is also an essential element of the project, considering its location. It is crucial to create a building that is easily identifiable and repeatable throughout the tramway to guide people around the campus.

The project is connected to Mashhad's subway system through an underground tunnel, providing an ideal opportunity to showcase the university's developments and its connection to the city.

Furthermore, the design incorporates a unique feature to remind people of the past. The semi-coned structure, reminiscent of ancient Iranian fridge shapes, serves as a reminder of history while providing users with a building that serves as a signpost. By blending the past with the present, the project showcases the university's commitment to preserving history while advancing forward.
