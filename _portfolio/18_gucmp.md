The Golestan University campus master plan project in Golestan province of Iran is a well-thought-out and comprehensive plan that incorporates various design elements to create an optimal learning environment. One of the significant design features of this project is the high roofs that provide ample space for natural light and ventilation. The openness of the northern and southern facades also helps to maximize the benefits of wind direction, allowing for natural ventilation to keep the interior spaces comfortable and healthy. The use of passive HVAC, which relies on natural ventilation, is an excellent addition that ensures energy efficiency and sustainability.

Another notable feature of this project is the placement of buildings at a minimum distance of 20m apart, with the inclusion of common spaces between them. This arrangement allows for a natural air circulation system that helps maintain a healthy indoor environment. Additionally, the transparent facades create a visual connection between the inside and out, enhancing the learning experience by providing a sense of openness and connection to the environment. The Western-Southern massing of buildings, combined with the protection from the winter winds and rain on the western and northwestern sides, creates a harmonious and functional environment that is conducive to learning and growth. Overall, the Golestan University campus master plan project is an exceptional design that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, providing a comfortable and sustainable learning environment for students and faculty alike.
