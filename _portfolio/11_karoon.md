The Karoon Office Building in Ahvaz, with its impressive 15 stories height, is a magnificent piece of architecture that stands out in the cityscape. The building is strategically located close to the Karoon River and south of it, providing a serene and picturesque backdrop. The project features a unique continuous surface design that flows seamlessly from the north-west side, creating a sense of harmony and unity with the surrounding environment. The fa√ßade of the building is made of glass, adding to the building's elegance and transparency.

The Karoon Office Building has been designed to meet the needs of modern businesses, with the ground floor being dedicated to a mall, while the first to fifth floors are reserved for parking. The rest of the building serves as office space, with the highest floor accommodating a restaurant. This building is a great example of how modern architecture can be integrated seamlessly into an urban environment, providing both form and function. Its design reflects the ever-evolving nature of the city of Ahvaz, and it is an excellent representation of modern Iranian architecture.
