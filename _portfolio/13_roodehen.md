The design of this magnificent villa was principally guided by the topographical disparity of the site's northern and southern facets. The introspective layout, meticulously divided into sections by triangular shapes, boasts several internal courtyards. The extraordinary geometry is evident in both the courtyard plans and the intricately shaped pitched roofs.

Incorporating the concept of folding architecture, this villa features a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. The clever use of folding elements in the façade and roof creates a fascinating interplay between indoor and outdoor spaces. The façade boasts a unique pattern of folds, which casts intriguing patterns of light and shadow throughout the day, lending a touch of drama to the villa's exterior. The roof's folding structure offers a seamless connection between the interior and the outdoor terraces, while also providing an impressive play of light and shadow, especially during sunset. The combination of the villa's unusual geometry and folding architecture creates a stunning visual spectacle that is both unique and functional.
