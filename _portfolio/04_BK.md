To create a glass facade from a synclastic surface, I developed a Grasshopper definition that panelizes the surface and adds a spaceframe structure using the Novum Block-Knoten system. This definition outputs a manufacturable model with all the necessary design data. Due to the project's complexity, I wrote custom code in C# for critical components within Grasshopper.
