In recent decades, the "Shahrak-e-Gharb (West Town)" of Tehran has experienced extensive development, establishing itself as one of the significant commercial and administrative centers in Tehran and the broader region. The area has gained prominence due to its spatial qualities, the historical background of upper-class residential floors, along with its avoidance of the city center's congestion and convenient access to roadways and public transportation. This has led to a continuous growth trend in commercial and administrative activities in the region.

As a result, the residential fabric is undergoing transformation, shifting towards an administrative structure. However, the coexistence and contrast between the administrative and commercial fabric are shaping a distinctive urban landscape. This area serves as the intersection of urban and local scales, fine-grained and coarse-grained structures, public and private realms, symbolical and generic elements, creating a unique urban environment.

The physical program of the project includes parking levels, ground floor for commercial and administrative services, and office floors. Considering the existing functions in the adjacent context and the limited diversity of the physical program, it seems more beneficial for the project program to be expanded towards creating greater diversity in activities and a distinctive identity for the administrative usage. This would align the created office units more effectively with current trends and enable them to benefit from greater competitive advantages.

The dual nature of the urban fabric of the "Shahrak-e-Gharb (West Town)" and the type of administrative and business activities established in it have led to a significant portion of the buildings having mixed-use functions of residential and administrative purposes. Many small businesses or those with a presence in multiple countries still require spaces that can provide hotel-like services, accommodation, and workspaces for them with minimal complexity in hosting meetings. In the present plan, the dual nature of the site extends beyond the formal diagram to influence the program as well, and a limited number of residential units associated with the administrative spaces are envisaged.

The project site is precisely situated on the edge of this boundary. Therefore, the land settlement of the project from the Farahzadi axis, which is the most important thoroughfare connected to San'at Square and is considered as the gateway to the West Town, on one side, and its placement on the edge of Hasan Seif Street, which is a secondary axis penetrating the residential fabric, leads to the formation of a high-rise building mass with a dual nature. This mass corresponds to a fine-grained context to the north but has an urban-scale impact on the region's skyline. In this regard, the building structure can manifest a dual and hybrid nature relative to these two urban zones.

The site's location relative to Farahzadi Boulevard and its access from the southern intersection in the southeast corner of the site turn it into a key point in the design. This allows the project to benefit from the advantage of direct connectivity to Farahzadi Boulevard. Therefore, a central axis is established from the northeast to the southwest within the site's diameter. This axis can create an attractive link between Hassan Seif Boulevard and the Farahzadi axis, enhancing the site's accessibility and connectivity capabilities.

The structure of the network and access in West Town is formed by two geometric systems: organic (in the main arteries) and orthogonal (in the residential fabric). As a result, many buildings constructed on large land plots along the edges of arterial roads have taken curved and arciform shapes due to the curvilinear lines. The magnetic fields created by the radiating force of these curves in the skyline, alongside other benefits of employing this geometry such as enhancing visual diversity and perspectives, make the strategic placement of the main mass within the volumetric coil of the curve a thoughtful and effective choice for the project.

Computational tools and algorithmic design enable the analysis of two key elements: shading on the residential fabric and the creation of the highest-quality views. This allows for the optimal depiction of the volumetric mass in the urban landscape. The resulting mass forms a void in the southern part of the site, connecting the eastern and western edges with a gentle curvature.

In the pursuit of achieving the best placement for the form on the site, an initial analysis is conducted on the surrounding views and perspectives. Considering the views from each point on the site at various elevations outward, scoring points are assigned. In the next stage, based on the permissible occupation level, the points that have garnered the highest scores are selected to shape the final form.

In the last step, the curves obtained from connecting the desired points at different elevations are linked, forming an optimized shape in terms of outward views and perspectives. This form is then refined with architectural considerations and considered as the foundational architectural form.

The overall volume in this design is a cohesive concrete mass formed by cutting an optimized volumetric coil from the network of intersecting vertical and horizontal planes. The base grid, with a six-meter modulation in the optimal climatic direction for effective solar energy absorption, facilitates the design and maximizes the parking structure with twelve-meter spans in the structural framework.

The volumetric coil, resulting from the optimization of mass placement according to the program, is created with two key parameters: shading on neighboring structures and creating the highest quality internal views. This optimization is implemented algorithmically on the site and adjacent structures, and the final result is integrated into the form generation and intersection with the plane network.

The final volume aims to pull the contrasting faces of the project, which is the central concept of the design, out of a pure geometric system with minimal appendages. The urban-scale view of the project is derived from a free-form and curved shape of the cut grid planes. The change in direction and curvature of these planes leaves lines reminiscent of topographic lines on the body, expressing an innovative and expressive form that echoes some foundational geometric principles in Islamic architecture, harmonizing with the shell geometry of adjacent structures like the Milad Tower.

On the other side, this volume, facing the residential fabric, becomes more granular and cellular, revealing another facet of itself. Finally, the interior space of the mass is created by introducing soft and arched cuts on the walls of the floors, blending the internal and overall nature of the mass into a harmonious unity.
