The Twisting tower project, aims to create a district focal point with accessible official-commercial spaces. To achieve this goal, the project should prioritize sustainability, legibility, skyline impact, and architectural technology. Sustainability is crucial, and strategies like green roofs and walls, renewable energy sources, and water conservation should be implemented. Legibility is important, and the building should be easy to understand and identifiable as a sign of the city's rich heritage. The impact of the project on the skyline should be carefully considered to ensure it complements the surrounding skyline. Finally, the project should leverage the latest advancements in construction materials and energy-efficient technologies.

This research aims to develop a practical method for architects designing buildings with a double skin facade (DSF) to achieve an optimized functional facade. The process uses any CFD analysis software, with this example using "OpenFOAM" through the "Butterfly" plugin for "Grasshopper" on Rhinoceros platform. The study uses the Twist morphology to determine the optimal twist angle and cavity depth for the building's functionality during summer in Tehran.

To begin, the constant values are defined as the first step, since numerous parameters affect the functionality of a DSF system, and it is not rational to indicate all of them as flexible variables in the analysis. An optimal state is generated using ASHRAE Standards for comparison.

Rather than running an optimization operation, the study divides the acceptable angle range into seven distinct answers and searches for the best among them, and applies the same approach to cavity depth, dividing the acceptable range into five different possible answers.

The analysis is conducted for each DSF zone (24 for each case) of each of the seven subject buildings with five different depths of cavity. The results show that the subject building with +60 degrees of twist is the overall best-performing one. A summary of all the results is provided in the table below.
