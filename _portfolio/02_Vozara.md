- **Result:** Second Place and the Chosen Project for Construction

The Royal 2 building, located on Vozara Street, is a semi-constructed structure that sits on top of Saee Park. This building will be one of Tehran's modern high-rise towers, situated in the northern section of Vozara Street, playing a significant role in shaping the visual appearance of this area.

In the design process, the aim was to present the audience with an abstract and concise image of buildings through a collage, by redefining the typology of Tehran's 1940s and 1950s facades. Furthermore, we attempted to critique the organism-like and cylindrical nature of high-rise buildings by creating empty spaces and a dialectic between full and empty spaces.

This project entails the design of the facade for a 20-story building, with two crucial factors being considered, the view and the amount of light that penetrates the building. The initial step was to divide each facade into smaller parts using Grasshopper and then assign a value to each of these parts based on our view and light analyses. We then drew inspiration from the building facades of Tehran from the 60s and 70s, analyzing their transparency levels, and used Grasshopper to select which design to place on each subpart of the facade. The facades were then divided into buildable metal panels, and a second panel was placed on top of the first to provide greater control over the amount of light and outside visibility.
