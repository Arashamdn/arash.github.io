In recent years, Islamic countries have been emphasizing the importance of blending Islamic traditions with contemporary design principles in university architecture. Ferdowsi University of Mashhad's physical outlook is shaped by its value-oriented viewpoint and physical needs, which aim to improve the university's spatial needs while adhering to sustainable development of Iranian-Islamic architecture patterns. The physical programming places great emphasis on achieving green university status, resource conservation, and environmental improvement.

The design team is determined to achieve these ambitious criteria by focusing on reducing environmental damages and promoting the use of renewable energies and green technologies.
